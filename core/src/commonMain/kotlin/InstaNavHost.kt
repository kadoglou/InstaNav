/**
 * A composable that uses multiple [TabNavHost] instances, one per tab, and ensures that each tab
 * maintains its own independent back stack â€” mimicking the behaviour seen in apps like Instagram or YouTube.
 *
 * This function only composes the tabs currently listed in [InstaNavHostState.openTabs].
 * When a tab is dismissed (i.e., popped from the stack), it is no longer composed,
 * freeing up memory and ensuring its state is reset when revisited later.
 *
 * @param state The [InstaNavHostState] that manages tab navigation logic and tab order.
 * @param tabs The list of all available tabs. Each tab includes a route and its starting destination.
 * @param tabNavControllers A mapping of each tab to its [NavHostController]. One controller per tab is required.
 * @param builder The shared navigation graph builder used to declare all screens used in every tab.
